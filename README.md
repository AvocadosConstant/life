# A comprehensive data analysis of my life.

To achieve a better understanding of how I spend my time, I aim to track and log many aspects of my life this year. This project will allow me to play around with some data science and data visualization techniques. I'm not sure what the final platform will look like, but as of now, the main script exists a basic python module.




## General Activities

I am using the Android app "[ATimeLogger](http://www.atimelogger.com/)" to track my day to day activities. This involves stopping and starting activities as I go throughout my day. So far, I have designed 16 categories of 41 total activity types. To keep the data clean, I do not allow activity overlaps and at any given time, I choose the activity that best represents what I'm doing at the time.

### Goals

    - Customized pie chart reports to compare how I spend my time
    - Trends line graphs




## Fitness

To log my strength training, I am using the Android app "[Strong](http://strongapp.io/)". Each workout I log the number of sets, repetitions, and weight used for each exercise.

### Features

    - Trends for volume, max weight, # sets, and # reps for exercises.

### Goals

    - Regression to predict further progression
